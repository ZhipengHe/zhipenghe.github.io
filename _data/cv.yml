    - "The focus of this research will be on addressing challenges related to adversarial robustness in tabular data. To accomplish this, the research will investigate cutting-edge attack techniques and analyse the characteristics of successful attacks on structured data. Furthermore, the study will propose an evaluation framework to benchmark these characteristics, aiming to develop defense mechanisms that ultimately enhance the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks in tabular data."
