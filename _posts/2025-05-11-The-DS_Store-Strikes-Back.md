## EPISODE VI: THE .DS_STORE STRIKES BACK

- **Darth `.DS_Store`**: "Your lack of `defaults write` is disturbing. My hidden files will spread across every folder you visit."

- **Luke:** "But I've tried `.gitignore`! It has no power here on remote connections!"

- **Yoda:** "Use the Terminal, Luke. Or the sacred command to disable .DS_Store on network volumes."

- **Han:** "I've been running from these hidden files for ten years. Not a remote server is safe in the galaxy!"

### The Solution: Clean Up the Dark Side

1. **Remove Existing .DS_Store Files**

   ```bash
   # Clean up all .DS_Store files
   find . -name ".DS_Store" -delete
   ```

2. **Prevent Future .DS_Store Creation**

   ```bash
   # Disable .DS_Store on network volumes
   defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool TRUE

   # Restart Finder to apply changes
   killall Finder
   ```

## EPISODE VI: THE RETURN OF THE METADATA (.\_\*)

> _"The .\_\* files are back, and they're more annoying than ever."_

!!! warning "The Hidden Menace"
When you copy files to a remote server, macOS creates mysterious `._*` files. They're like the Ewoks of the file system - small, seemingly harmless, but they can cause big problems.

- **Darth Metadata**: "Your files are not complete without my metadata. I will follow them everywhere."

- **Luke**: "But these `._*` files are causing issues with my Python scripts!"

- **Yoda**: "Hidden they are, but dangerous they can be. Clean them you must."

### The Solution: Defeat the Metadata Menace

1.  **Remove Existing Metadata Files**

    ```bash
    # Remove all ._ files
    find . -name "._*" -delete

    # Or clean both .DS_Store and ._ files
    find . -type f -name "._*" -o -name ".DS_Store" -delete
    ```

2.  **Understanding the .\_\* Files - The Unstoppable Force**

    On macOS, preventing the creation of `._*` files (AppleDouble metadata) entirely is not officially supportedâ€”especially on non-HFS+ or non-APFS volumes.

    **Why .\_\* files are created:**
    macOS uses .\_\* AppleDouble files to store:

        - Resource forks
        - Extended attributes (e.g., custom icons, tags)
        - Finder metadata

        These are automatically created when copying files to filesystems that don't support extended attributes, such as:
        - SMB shares (Linux Samba servers)
        - FAT, exFAT, NTFS drives
        - Some WebDAV volumes

3.  **Best Available Solutions :question:**

    **_Just kidding, there are no best available solutions for this problem._** That's why I said mount the remote server as a local drive by Finder is not an elegant solution (Check [this](/blog/2025/Surviving-without-VS-Code-Remote-SSH/#but--is-this-method-elegant).

4.  **For Git Users**

    Add the following to your .gitignore file:

    ```bash
    # Add to your .gitignore (won't prevent creation, but prevents tracking)
    echo "._*\n.DS_Store" >> .gitignore
    ```

## Final Words

> _"The Force is strong with clean file systems."_

May your remote development be free of metadata files, and may the Force be with you! ðŸš€
