> In [last post](/blog/2025/Docker-API-Exposure-Linux), I've shown how to expose Docker's API (port 2376) to your Tailscale VPN network on Linux systems. This post is a continuation of that guide, but for Windows with WSL2 backend.

## Overview

This guide shows how to expose Docker's API (port 2375) to your Tailscale VPN network on Windows with WSL2 backend. It's a simple guide for those who want to use Docker remotely or access the status of Docker Containers from another device.

> ##### WARNING
>
> We're using port 2375 **without SSL/TLS encryption**. Thus, you need to use a VPN tunnel to provide encryption and access control.
{: .block-warning }

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop for Windows with WSL2 backend
- Tailscale VPN installed and running
- Administrator access to Windows

## Step 1: Enable Docker API in Docker Desktop

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to **Settings ‚Üí General**
3. Check **"Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"**
4. Click **Apply & Restart**

## Step 2: Find Your Tailscale IP Address

```cmd
ipconfig
```
Look for the **Tailscale adapter** - note the IPv4 address (e.g., `100.xxx.xxx.xxx`)

## Step 3: Set Up Port Forwarding (Run as Administrator)

### Open PowerShell as Administrator:

- Press `Win + X` ‚Üí Select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)"
- Or press `Win + R` ‚Üí type `powershell` ‚Üí press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`

### Run these commands:

```cmd
# Add port forwarding rule (replace with your Tailscale IP)
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2375 listenaddress=100.xxx.xxx.xxx connectport=2375 connectaddress=127.0.0.1

# Configure Windows Firewall (Optional but recommended)
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Docker API Tailscale" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=2375
```

## Step 4: Verify Setup

```cmd
# Check port forwarding rules
netsh interface portproxy show all
```

Expected output:
```
Listen on ipv4:             Connect to ipv4:
Address         Port        Address         Port
--------------- ----------  --------------- ----------
100.xxx.xxx.xxx 2375        127.0.0.1       2375
```

## Step 5: Test Connection

From any device on your Tailscale network:
```bash
# Test Docker connection
docker -H tcp://100.xxx.xxx.xxx:2375 version

# Or test port connectivity
telnet 100.xxx.xxx.xxx 2375
```

## Cleanup Commands (if needed)

```cmd
# Remove port forwarding rule
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=2375 listenaddress=100.xxx.xxx.xxx

# Remove firewall rule
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Docker API Tailscale"
```

## Security Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This exposes Docker daemon without TLS encryption
- ‚úÖ **Safe**: Tailscale provides encrypted VPN tunnel
- üîí **Access**: Only devices on your Tailscale network can connect
- üí° **Tip**: Tailscale IPs are usually stable and don't change frequently

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can use Docker remotely:
```bash
# Set environment variable for easier use
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://100.xxx.xxx.xxx:2375

# Now use Docker commands normally
docker ps
docker images
docker run hello-world
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused**: Check if Docker Desktop is running
- **Port not accessible**: Verify firewall rules and port forwarding
- **Permission denied**: Ensure commands were run as Administrator
- **Tailscale IP changed**: Update port forwarding rule with new IP
